# Typing Game

### Ideas?
* Contribute here:


### Things we need:
* Name for the game?
 * (Matt) _"Typing game" is kinda lame ;-)_
* Firebase authentication (user logins)
 * There are multiple providers but just github to start, since everyone has an account
 * (Matt) _Anyone who wants to play with this (read the documentation, try a login with their Firebase project) is welcome_
* Modal popup for login, or page transition from login to game
 * Input verification is a requirement -> could check for empty username or password
* Testing of word source APIs
 * The more the merrier!
 * Post any details here (at the end, or wherever makes sense)
* A "leaderboard" / stats page
 * Would satisfy the table data requirement
 * Could have a list of past games & outcomes, and a separate leaderboard page for the top scores/scorers
 * Have a button below the game, and have the game fade out and fade in leaderboard?  (With "back to game" button?)


### Things we will probably want:
* Sound effects!
 * (Matt) _Really easy to implement, I can just pull the code from my hangman game_
 * For: correct letter, wrong letter, finishing a word, beating a boss, level completion, game over ...
 * Feel free to download and test sound effects from anywhere, mp3 is probably best format
* Backgrounds
 * One for the entire page, or just a solid color?
 * (Matt) _Thinking we will want to have different backgrounds for different "levels" at a minimum_
* Other art assets
 * For: Correct letter, wrong letter, finishing a word, level completion, game over ...
 * Possibly: Health display, powerups (score multiplier?), any other ideas ...
* Fonts
 * One for all the game words, another for the rest of the page text
* Working setup for mobile/tablet devices without a real keyboard
 * (Matt) _Anyone who wants to research/test this is welcome_
* Bootstrap theme and/or custom CSS
 * Lots of free themes out there!
* An info page
 * Our names
 * Purpose of project
 * List of APIs used
 * etc ...
* Navbar or similar navigation for other pages
 * (Matt) _I'm thinking we should dynamically load content for other "pages" and just have index.html, would be nicer_
